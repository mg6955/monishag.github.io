 # Projects
 
 ## Database Design and Web based UI for a Library Management System
  This project aimed to design a relational database (using **Oracle Data Modeler**) that stores all the data about a Library. Using relational database system (**MySQL**) to perform (CURD â€“ Create (Insert), Update, Read, Delete records) operations.A web-based user interface for the Database schema designed is implemented using Django and Javascript. In particular, users should be able to register, login, and can perform business activities.

 ## Inverting a pendulum using Q-learning
  The goal of this project is to learn a policy for an inverted pendulum model to make it do a swing-up motion. Beyond the task of inverting a pendulum, the goal is to also gain an understanding on how Q-learning works, its limitations and advantages.The cost mostly penalizes deviations from the inverted position but also encourages small velocities and control. The Q learning is implemented with a learning table manually constructed initially followed by constructing a learned Q table.

 ## MuGAN - Generating Adversarial Modified Music
  This work focuses on attempting to allow one to generate music of different emotions or genres from existing music of various duration without being subject to a copyright claim as it is easier for an amateur to create music from an existing music rather than create a
 new one by transforming music to images and using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate images that is further transformed into music.
 
 ## Smart Stalkers: An Analysis of Smart Trackers as Tools for Interpersonal Surveillance
  This study analyzes the repurpose of AirTag, Apple Watch, Tile tracker, Samsung Smart Tag, Skullcandy earbuds for Interpersonal surveillance, evaluated the capabilities and drawbacks of publicly available and academic research mobile applications that claim to discover these devices on efficiency and ease of use and reviewed the current law and regulations against stalking.
